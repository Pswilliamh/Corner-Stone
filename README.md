# English Leap for Students

This is a Next.js application designed to help students, particularly in Indonesia, learn English. 
The app focuses on teaching letters, words, sentences, and pronunciation with an interactive and engaging approach.

## Features (Planned)

-   **Alphabet Learning:** Interactive lessons for each letter.
-   **Vocabulary Builder:** Thematic word sets with images, audio, and translations.
-   **Sentence Construction:** Exercises to practice forming basic English sentences.
-   **Pronunciation Practice:** Audio playback for words and sentences, potentially with recording/feedback.
-   **Indonesian to English Support:** Translation aids and contextual learning.

## Tech Stack

-   Next.js (App Router)
-   React
-   TypeScript
-   Tailwind CSS
-   ShadCN UI components
-   Genkit for potential AI features like advanced TTS or translation, if needed

## Getting Started

To get started with development:

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The app will be available at `http://localhost:9003` by default.

This project is a fresh start. Ensure you have the necessary ShadCN UI components (like `Button`) installed if you plan to use them, or replace them with basic HTML elements initially. The current header uses a `Button` component that would typically come from ` '@/components/ui/button';`.
